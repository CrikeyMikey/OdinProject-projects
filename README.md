This project will be a simple webpage that will have links to some recipes and have some styled texts and a couple images.
This project is made by Aydan Hoover on the 8th of December, 2022.

The skills that I have learned and put to use in this project so far include (The boilerplate template, unordered and ordered lists, different hearder sizes, paragraphs, light levels of nesting, using comments, using images, and alternate text.)
